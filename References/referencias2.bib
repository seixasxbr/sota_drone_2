abstract = {A major limitation of existing battery-powered quadrotor UAVs is their reduced flight endurance. To address this issue, by leveraging the electrical model of a brushless DC motor, we explicitly determine minimum-energy paths between a predefined initial and final configuration of a quadrotor by solving an optimal control problem with respect to the angular accelerations of the four propellers. As a variation on this problem, if the total energy consumption between two boundary states is fixed, minimum-time and/or minimum-control-effort trajectories are computed for the aerial vehicle. The theory is illustrated for the DJI Phantom 2 quadrotor in three realistic scenarios.},

abstract = {Central Force Optimization (CFO) is a new deterministic multi-dimensional search metaheuristic based on the metaphor of gravitational kinematics. It models "probes" that "fly" through the decision space by analogy to masses moving under the influence of gravity. Equations are developed for the probes' positions and accelerations using the analogy of particle motion in a gravitational field. In the physical universe, objects traveling through three-dimensional space become trapped in close orbits around highly gravitating masses, which is analogous to locating the maximum value of an objective function. In the CFO metaphor, "mass" is a user-defined function of the value of the objective function to be maximized. CFO is readily implemented in a compact computer program, and sample pseudocode is presented. As tests of CFO's effectiveness, an equalizer is designed for the well-known Fano load, and a 32-element linear array is synthesized. CFO results are compared to several other optimization methods.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a nonlinear robust control strategy to solve the load transportation problem by using a quadrotor UAV along a predefined trajectory. For the present study, the aim is to perform path tracking of the aircraft with load's swing-free, even in the presence of parametric uncertainties and exogenous disturbances. The system is modeled via Euler-Lagrange formulation considering both the dynamics of the quadrotor UAV and the suspended load. A nonlinear H∞ controller for underactuated mechanical systems is proposed taking into account both actuated DOF due to input-coupling and unactuated ones. Furthermore, an additional control law obtained through the Lyapunov redesign technique is summed to the nonlinear H∞ controller in order to reduce the load's swing. Simulation results are carried out to corroborate the proposed control strategy.},

Both of the hardware and the software platforms have been developed and tested for the proposed approaches. The proposed navigation scheme is illustrated by processing the video images captured by an unmanned aerial vehicle flying around a Navy vessel, YP-700.

In this work, we propose an architecture that avoids sensor limitations while allowing for accurate relative pose estimation, even in the presence of wind disturbances. The final landing sequence is performed entirely in the body-fixed inertial frame so that noisy measurements from the GPS and magnetometer sensors do not degrade the relative estimation accuracy.

abstract = {In this paper we consider an online planning problem for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations. Specifically, a UAV has the task of reaching a goal from a set of possible goals while minimizing the amount of energy required. Due to unforeseen disturbances, it is possible that initially attractive goals might end up being very expensive during the execution. Thus, two main problems are investigated here: i) how to predict and plan the motion of the UAV at run time to minimize its energy consumption and ii) when to schedule next replanning time to avoid unnecessary periodic re-evaluation executions. Our approach considers a nonlinear model of the system for which a model predictive controller is used to determine the desired control inputs for each possible goal. These control inputs are then used to estimate the energy required to reach the different goals. Finally, a self-triggered scheduling policy determines how long to wait before replanning the goal to aim for. The proposed framework is validated through simulations and experiments in which a quadrotor must choose and reach some goal while being subject to external disturbances.},

In this paper, we present an approach that allows a quadrotor with a single monocular camera to locally generate collision-free waypoints. We acquire a small set of images while the quadrotor is hovering from which we compute a dense depth map. Based on this depth map, we render a 2Dscan and generate a suitablewaypoint for navigation. In our experiments, wefound that the pose variation during hovering is already sufficient to obtain suitable depthmaps. The computation takes less than one second which renders our approach applicable for obstacle avoidance in real-time. We demonstrate the validity of our approach in challenging environmentswherewe navigate a ParrotArdrone quadrotor successfully through narrow passages including doors, boxes, and people.},

abstract = {The development of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is of high interest to many governmental and military organizations around the world. An essential aspect of UAV autonomy is the ability for automatic path planning. In this paper, we use the genetic algorithm (GA) and the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) to cope with the complexity of the problem and compute feasible and quasi-optimal trajectories for fixed wing UAVs in a complex 3D environment, while considering the dynamic properties of the vehicle. The characteristics of the optimal path are represented in the form of a multiobjective cost function that we developed. The paths produced are composed of line segments, circular arcs and vertical helices. We reduce the execution time of our solutions by using the 'single-program, multiple-data' parallel programming paradigm and we achieve real-time performance on standard commercial off-the-shelf multicore CPUs. After achieving a quasi-linear speedup of 7.3 on 8 cores and an execution time of 10 s for both algorithms, we conclude that by using a parallel implementation on standard multicore CPUs, real-time path planning for UAVs is possible. Moreover, our rigorous comparison of the two algorithms shows, with statistical significance, that the GA produces superior trajectories to the PSO. {\textcopyright} 2005-2012 IEEE.},

However, the diversification of sensing systems and user applications challenges the common application of good practice procedures that ensure the quality of the data. This challenge can only be met by establishing and communicating common procedures that have had demonstrated success in scientific experiments and operational demonstrations.

abstract = {Cargo-bearing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have tremendous potential to assist humans by delivering food, medicine, and other supplies. For time-critical cargo delivery tasks, UAVs need to be able to quickly navigate their environments and deliver suspended payloads with bounded load displacement. As a constraint balancing task for joint UAV-suspended load system dynamics, this task poses a challenge. This article presents a reinforcement learning approach for aerial cargo delivery tasks in environments with static obstacles. We first learn a minimal residual oscillations task policy in obstacle-free environments using a specifically designed feature vector for value function approximation that allows generalization beyond the training domain. The method works in continuous state and discrete action spaces. Since planning for aerial cargo requires very large action space (over 106 actions) that is impractical for learning, we define formal conditions for a class of robotics problems where learning can occur in a simplified problem space and successfully transfer to a broader problem space. Exploiting these guarantees and relying on the discrete action space, we learn the swing-free policy in a subspace several orders of magnitude smaller, and later develop a method for swing-free trajectory planning along a path. As an extension to tasks in environments with static obstacles where the load displacement needs to be bounded throughout the trajectory, sampling-based motion planning generates collision-free paths. Next, a reinforcement learning agent transforms these paths into trajectories that maintain the bound on the load displacement while following the collision-free path in a timely manner. We verify the approach both in simulation and in experiments on a quadrotor with suspended load and verify the method's safety and feasibility through a demonstration where a quadrotor delivers an open container of liquid to a human subject. The contributions of this work are two-fold. First, this article presents a solution to a challenging, and vital problem of planning a constraint-balancing task for an inherently unstable non-linear system in the presence of obstacles. Second, AI and robotics researchers can both benefit from the provided theoretical guarantees of system stability on a class of constraint-balancing tasks that occur in very large action spaces.},

abstract = {Precise trajectory tracking control for a quadcopter aerial vehicle using only a monocular camera and inertial sensing for localization is introduced in this work. Two different control laws based on linear behavior are proposed to follow desired trajectories. The algorithms are validated in real-time in the low-cost Parrot AR.Drone vehicle. Time-scale separation of the traslational and rotational dynamics allows to design controllers for the position of the quadrotor by giving desired reference roll and pitch angles to the internal autopilot. Localization is achieved via monocular SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and a suitable state estimator, both available as open-source code. The experimental results depicted in some graphs show the good behavior of the closed-loop system.},

abstract = {This paper describes an approach to motion generation for quadrotor micro-UAV's navigating cluttered and partially known environments. We pursue a graph search method that, despite the high dimensionality of the problem, the complex dynamics of the system and the continuously changing environment model is capable of generating dynamically feasible motions in real-time. This is enabled by leveraging the differential flatness property of the system and by developing a structured search space based on state lattice motion primitives. We suggest a greedy algorithm to generate these primitives off-line automatically, given the robot's motion model. The process samples the reachability of the system and reduces it to a set of representative, canonical motions that are compatible with the state lattice structure, which guarantees that any incremental replanning algorithm is able to produce smooth dynamically feasible motion plans while reusing previous computation between replans. Simulated and physical experimental results demonstrate real-time replanning due to the inevitable and frequent world model updates during micro-UAV motion in partially known environments. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Regular monitoring of animal populations must be established to ensure wildlife protection, especially when pressure on animals is high. The recent development of drones or unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) opens new opportunities. UASs have several advantages, including providing data at high spatial and temporal resolution, providing systematic, permanent data, having low operational costs and being low-risk for the operators. However, UASs have some constraints, such as short flight endurance. We reviewed studies in which wildlife populations were monitored by using drones, described accomplishments to date and evaluated the range of possibilities UASs offer to provide new perspectives in future research. We focused on four main topics: 1) the available systems and sensors; 2) the types of survey plan and detection possibilities; 3) contributions towards anti-poaching surveillance; and 4) legislation and ethics. We found that small fixed-wing UASs are most commonly used because these aircraft provide a viable compromise between price, logistics and flight endurance. The sensors are typically electro-optic or infrared cameras, but there is the potential to develop and test new sensors. Despite various flight plan possibilities, mostly classical line transects have been employed, and it would be of great interest to test new methods to adapt to the limitations of UASs. Detection of many species is possible, but statistical approaches are unavailable if valid inventories of large mammals are the purpose. Contributions of UASs to anti-poaching surveillance are not yet well documented in the scientific literature, but initial studies indicate that this approach could make important contributions to conservation in the next few years. Finally, we conclude that one of the main factors impeding the use of UASs is legislation. Restrictions in the use of airspace prevent researchers from testing all possibilities, and adaptations to the relevant legislation will be necessary in future.},

The proposed framework includes a simplified battery model that incorporates the electric load dependence, temperature dependence and SOC dependence by using the concept of Artificial Evolution to estimate some of its parameters, along with a novel Outer Feedback Correction Loop (OFCL) during the estimation stage which adjusts the variance of the process noise to diminish bias in Bayesian state estimation and helps to compensate problems associated with incorrect initial conditions in a non-observable dynamic system. Also, it provides an aerodynamic-based characterization of future power consumption profiles. A quadrotor has been used as validation platform. The results of this work will allow making decisions about the flight plan and having enough confidence in those decisions so that the mission objectives can be optimally achieved.},

abstract = {Designing and selecting hardware for a multirotor can be challenging in order to get the best flight performance out of the system. In addition to selecting the hardware, the number of actuators can also be altered. For a 4 actuator (quadrotor) setup, one set of hardware can give the optimal design, while for a 6 actuator setup (hexarotor) the same hardware may not necessarily give the same response. In this paper we present a design optimization process of a multirotor, where the hardware is selected from a set of low-cost off-the-shelf standard RC hobby parts. Constraining the problem to a given hardware ensures existence of the selected hardware, and the design can be implemented. Also the system equations will remain linear when selecting from a set of given data. Hence the problem is defined as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) and solved with the Cplex solver. The Cplex solver is fast and the solution is close to the optimal solution of the problem. In this paper the multirotor is designed for 4, 6 and 8 actuators, and the design with the lowest value of the objective function is the optimal design. As shown, optimizing the design for a given set of hardware and payload results in a 11 minutes longer time of flight, than just using the biggest propeller, motor and battery available.},

abstract = {We present Kinodynamic RRT*, an incremental sampling-based approach for asymptotically optimal motion planning for robots with linear dynamics. Our approach extends RRT*, which was introduced for holonomic robots [10], by using a fixed-final-state-free-final-time controller that optimally connects any pair of states, where the cost function is expressed as a trade-off between the duration of a trajectory and the expended control effort. Our approach generalizes earlier work on RRT* for kinodynamic systems, as it guarantees asymptotic optimality for any system with controllable linear dynamics, in state spaces of any dimension. In addition, we show that for the rich subclass of systems with a nilpotent dynamics matrix, closed-form solutions for optimal trajectories can be derived, which keeps the computational overhead of our algorithm compared to traditional RRT* at a minimum. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by computing asymptotically optimal trajectories in three challenging motion planning scenarios: (i) a planar robot with a 4-D state space and double integrator dynamics, (ii) an aerial vehicle with a 10-D state space and linearized quadrotor dynamics, and (iii) a car-like robot with a 5-D state space and non-linear dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

This technology provides a state assessment of the health of components of interest, and if a degraded state has been found, it estimates how long it will take before the equipment will reach a failure threshold, conditional on assumptions about future operating conditions and future environmental conditions. This chapter explores the technical underpinnings of how to perform prognostics and shows an implementation on the propulsion of an electric UAV. An accurate run-time battery life prediction algorithm is of critical importance to ensure the safe operation of the vehicle if one wants to maximize in-air time. Current reliability-based techniques turn out to be insufficient to manage the use of such batteries where loads vary frequently in uncertain environments. A Particle Filter is shown as the method of choice in performing state assessment and predicting future degradation. The method is then applied to the batteries that provide power to the propeller motors.},

The UAVs have limited sensor and communication ranges, when they detect a pop-up or a moving obstacle that is in the collision course with the UAV flight path, then it has to replan a new optimal path from its current location to the goal. Determining optimal paths with short time intervals is not feasible, hence we develop anytime algorithm using particle swarm optimization that yields paths whose quality increases with increase in available computation time. To track the given path by the anytime algorithm in 3D, we developed a new uav guidance law that is based on a combination of pursuit guidance law and line of sight guidance law from missile guidance literature. Simulations are carried out to show that the anytime algorithm produces good paths in a relatively short time interval and the guidance law allows the UAVs to track the generated path. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

In the path planning process, the idea from the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and the mutation operator of the genetic algorithm (GA) are applied to improve the original CFO method. Furthermore, the convergence analysis of the whole MCFO method is established by the linear difference equation method. Then, in order to verify the effectiveness and practicality of this new path planning method, the path following process is put forward based on the six-degree-of-freedom quadrotor helicopter control system. At last, the comparison simulations among the six algorithms show that the trajectories produced by the whole MCFO method are more superior than the original CFO algorithm, the GA, the Firefly algorithm (FA), the PSO algorithm, the random search (RS) way and the other MCFO algorithm under the same conditions. What is more, the path following process results show that the path planning results are practical for the real dynamic model of the quadrotor helicopter.},

Current designs have often considered only nominal operating conditions for vehicle control design. This work seeks to address issues that arise when deviating significantly from the hover flight regime. Aided by well established research for helicopter flight control, three separate aerodynamic effects are investigated as they pertain to quadrotor flight, due to vehicular velocity, angle of attack, and airframe design. They cause moments that affect attitude control, and thrust variation that affects altitude control. Where possible, a theoretical development is first presented, and is then validated through both thrust test stand measurements and vehicle flight tests using the Stanford Testbed of Autonomous Rotorcraft for Multi-Agent Control (STARMAC) quadrotor helicopter. The results enabled improved controller performance.},

Recently, there has been increasing interest in quadrotor UAVs. Exciting videos have been published on the Internet by many research groups and have attracted much attention from the public [1][7]. Relatively simple structures of quadrotors has promoted interest from academia, UAV industries, and radio-control (RC) hobbyists alike. Unlike conventional helicopters, swashplates, which are prone to failure without constant maintenance, are not required. Furthermore, the diameter of individual rotors can be reduced as a result of the presence of four actuators [8]. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {Small helicopter control is a topic of wide interest. The generally accepted model includes the effect of so-called Small Body Forces (SBF) which couple the rotational inputs to the translational dynamics. The SBF include the tail rotor thrust and the lateral forces due to the main rotor flapping which are used to force the rotational dynamics. Since the SBF render the model non-minimum phase, it has become customary in the literature to neglect their effect in order to design a model-based control with rigorously defined performance guarantees. We present a control design which directly compensates the influence of the tail rotor component of the SBF on the translational dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2013 AACC American Automatic Control Council.},

Multi-rotor systems, such as quadrotors, are light-weight and easy to operate. They are available in different sizes and with the wide range of capabilities. The main limitation of electric-powered UAVs is their range and endurance, due the limited battery capacity. Increasing battery system size is not a viable solution as its weight becomes a limiting factor. Supercapacitors are not an option, because of their low energy density. An alternative is to recharge UAV on the job, using wireless energy transfer (WET). WET was originally investigated by Nikola Tesla in the beginning of the 20th century. His patents are now common ground for any power transmission technology research, both wired and wireless. Investigations in resonance-based wireless energy transfer promise efficient wireless power transmission over several meters. This offers an ability to recharge moving vehicles, such as cars, trains and UAVs, wirelessly. For example, this technology can be applied to extend the range of UAVs used for the inspection of power transmission lines and towers.

A sliding mode controller is first developed to ensure fast convergence speed with the desired reference, and then the backstepping technique is used until the desired reference trajectory is achieved and finally the appropriate control laws are obtained. In order to achieve the precise and fast localization of a quadrotor, a popular visual odometry algorithm is applied to gathering good position information required in motion estimation.

abstract = {The major goal of this research was the development and implementation of a control system able to avoid collisions during the flight for a mini-quadrotor helicopter, based only on its embedded sensors without changing the environment. However, it is important to highlight that the design aspects must be seriously considered in order to overcome hardware limitations and achieve control simplification. The controllers of a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) robot deal with highly unstable dynamics and strong axes coupling. Furthermore, any additional embedded sensor increases the robot total weight and therefore, decreases its operating time. The best balance between embedded electronics and robot operating time is desired. This paper focuses not only on the development and implementation of a collision avoidance controller for a mini-robotic helicopter using only its embedded sensors, but also on the mathematical model that was essential for the controller developing phases. Based on this model we carried out the development of a simulation tool based on MatLab/Simulink that was fundamental for setting the controllers' parameters. This tool allowed us to simulate and improve the OS4 controllers in different modeled environments and test different approaches. After that, the controllers were embedded in the real robot and the results proved to be very robust and feasible. In addition to this, the controller has the advantage of being compatible with future path planners that we are developing. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2012 by ABCM.},

The cooperating team comprises two vehicles with complementary capabilities, a truck restricted to travel along a street network, and a quadrotor micro-aerial vehicle of capacity one that can be deployed from the truck to perform deliveries. The problem is formulated as an optimal path planning problem on a graph and the goal is to find the shortest cooperative route enabling the quadrotor to deliver items at all requested locations. The problem is shown to be NP-hard. A solution is then proposed using a novel reduction to the Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem, for which well-established heuristic solvers exist. The heterogeneous delivery problem contains as a special case the problem of scheduling deliveries from multiple static warehouses. We propose two additional algorithms, based on enumeration and a reduction to the traveling salesman problem, for this special case. Simulation results compare the performance of the presented algorithms and demonstrate examples of delivery route computations over real urban street maps.},

In addition, due to the introduction of super twisting mechanism, the controller can restrain chattering effect of sliding mode control.

A Kalman filter (KF) is utilised to fuse the estimated pose from semi-direct monocular visual odometry (SVO) with data from inertial measurement unit (IMU).

The functional optimisation method is applied to reform this problem into an optimal control problem. The whole transformation process is deduced in detail, based on a discrete UAV dynamic model. Then, the path planning problem is solved with the help of the optimal control method. The path following process based on the six degrees of freedom simulation model of the quadrotor helicopters is introduced to verify the practicability of this method. Finally, the simulation results show that the improved method is more effective in planning path. In the planning space, the length of the calculated path is shorter and smoother than that using traditional APF method.

abstract = {Worldwide demand for robotic aircraft such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) is surging. Not only military but especially civil applications are being developed at a rapid pace. Unmanned vehicles offer major advantages when used for aerial surveillance, reconnaissance, and inspection in complex and inhospitable environments. UAVs are better suited for dirty or dangerous missions than manned aircraft and are more cost-effective. UAVs can operate in contaminated environments, for example, and at altitudes both lower and higher than those typically traversed by manned aircraft. Many technological, economic, and political factors have encouraged the development and operation of UAVs. New sensors, microprocessors, and propulsion systems are smaller, lighter, and more capable, leading to levels of endurance, efficiency, and autonomy that exceed human capacities. Comprising the latest research, this book describes step by step the development of small or miniature unmanned aerial vehicles and discusses in detail the integrated prototypes developed at the robotics laboratory of Chiba University. With demonstration videos, the book will interest not only graduate students, scientists, and engineers but also newcomers to the field. {\textcopyright} Springer 2010. All rights are reserved.},

Especially, in the developing countries like India, over 70{\%} of the rural people depends upon the agriculture fields. The agriculture fields faces dramatic losses due to the diseases. These diseases came from the pests and insets, which reduces the productivity of the crops. Pesticides and fertilizers are used to kill the insects and pests in order to enhance the crop quality. The WHO (World Health Organization) estimated as one million cases of ill effected, when spraying the pesticides in the crop filed manually. The Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aircrafts are used to spray the pesticides to avoid the health problems of humans when they spray manually. UAVs can be used easily, where the equipment and labors difficulty to operate. This paper reviews briefly the implementation of UAVs for crop monitoring and pesticide spraying.},

UAVs are finding applications in various areas ranging from military applications to traffic surveillance. This paper is a survey for a certain kind of UAV called quadrotor or quadcopter. Researchers are frequently choosing quadrotors for their research because a quadrotor can accurately and efficiently perform tasks that would be of high risk for a human pilot to perform. This paper encompasses the dynamic models of a quadrotor and the different model-dependent and model-independent control techniques and their comparison. Recently, focus has shifted to designing autonomous quadrotors. A summary of the various localization and navigation techniques has been given. Lastly, the paper investigates the potential applications of quadrotors and their role in multi-agent systems. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Control system design of aerospace vehicles with actuator saturation is an important practical design problem that many previous approaches to nonlinear autopilot design did not consider. In particular, small unmanned aerial vehicle rotorcraft actuators often have physical limitations such as a restricted onboard power supply. Disregard of actuator saturation can affect the final performance, but the reduction in performance can be mitigated if actuator saturation is included in the controller design. In this paper, we propose a nested-saturation-based nonlinear controller for the stabilization of a rotary-wing aircraft This control strategy allows the incorporation of actuator magnitude saturation and has satisfactory dynamic performance. The nested-saturation technique enables the controller to ensure the global asymptotic stability of a quadrotor helicopter while improving the performance of the closed-loop system. By using Lyapunov analysis, the convergence property is established for the complete nonlinear model of the quadrotor rotorcraft. Simulation results show the performance of the proposed control strategy. Using embedded sensors and onboard control, we performed a real-time autonomous flight. Indeed, experimental results have shown that the proposed control strategy is able to autonomously perform the tasks of taking off, hovering, and landing.

Also, in order to utilize recent advances in machine intelligence and deep learning we need to collect a large amount of annotated training data in a variety of conditions and environments. We present a new simulator built on Unreal Engine that offers physically and visually realistic simulations for both of these goals. Our simulator includes a physics engine that can operate at a high frequency for real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations with support for popular protocols (e.g. MavLink). The simulator is designed from the ground up to be extensible to accommodate new types of vehicles, hardware platforms and software protocols. In addition, the modular design enables various components to be easily usable independently in other projects. We demonstrate the simulator by first implementing a quadrotor as an autonomous vehicle and then experimentally comparing the software components with real-world flights.},

abstract = {This thesis is about modelling, design and control of Miniature Flying Robots (MFR) with a focus on Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) systems and specifically, micro quadrotors. It introduces a mathematical model for simu- lation and control of such systems. It then describes a design methodology for a miniature rotorcraft. The methodology is subsequently applied to design an autonomous quadrotor named OS4. Based on the mathematical model, linear and nonlinear control techniques are used to design and simulate var- ious controllers along this work. The dynamic model and the simulator evolved from a simple set of equa- tions, valid only for hovering, to a complex mathematical model with more realistic aerodynamic coefficients and sensor and actuator models. Two platforms were developed during this thesis. The first one is a quadrotor- like test-bench with off-board data processing and power supply. It was used to safely and easily test control strategies. The second one, OS4, is a highly integrated quadrotor with on-board data processing and power supply. It has all the necessary sensors for autonomous operation. Five different controllers were developed. The first one, based on Lyapunov theory, was applied for attitude control. The second and the third controllers are based on PID and LQ techniques. These were compared for attitude con- trol. The fourth and the fifth approaches use backstepping and sliding-mode concepts. They are applied to control attitude. Finally, backstepping is aug- mented with integral action and proposed as a single tool to design attitude, altitude and position controllers. This approach is validated through various flight experiments conducted on the OS4. Key},

We model the system as a hybrid dynamical system and formulate the trajectory generation problem as a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP). Specifically, we address two novel challenges. First, we plan for a multi-body system, and obstacle avoidance must be guaranteed for the quadrotor, load, and the cable. Second, our method accommodates transitions between subsystems of the hybrid dynamical system, allowing for maneuvers that would otherwise be infeasible if the cable were constrained to remain taut. Numerical and experimental results validate the proposed approach for the full hybrid system.},

IR light has higher transmittance and the hemispherical design provides wide angle radiation. We present the fabrication process of the hemispherical marker from a planar flexible film, followed by full system integration on the ground vehicle. The relatively compact (radius: 2.25 cm, height: 2.3 cm) marker is detectable from wide altitude angles (0-180) and detectable even when covered by thin foreign objects such as fallen leaves or plastic bags.
